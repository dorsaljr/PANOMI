# PANOMI - Polish & Improvements Plan

## Critical
- [x] **Error handling** - Silent failures with debug logging
- [x] **Empty states** - Not needed, UI is intuitive as-is
- [ ] **Loading states** - Spinners/skeletons while scanning library

## Important
- [x] **Game artwork caching** - Already implemented (icons saved to AppData)
- [x] **Auto-update mechanism** - Velopack with GitHub Releases (silent background check)
- [ ] **Installer/packaging** - MSIX or installer for distribution
- [ ] **About/Settings page** - Version info, links, credits

## Polish
- [ ] **Keyboard navigation** - Arrow keys, Enter to launch
- [ ] **Accessibility** - Screen reader support, contrast
- [ ] **Tooltips** - Hover info on buttons/cards
- [ ] **Confirmation dialogs** - "Reset library?" confirmation

## Testing
- [ ] **Edge cases** - Uninstalled games, moved folders, multiple Steam libraries
- [ ] **Windows versions** - Test on Win10/11 variants

## Nice to Have
- [ ] **Recently played** - Track launch history
- [ ] **Play time tracking** - Monitor active game processes
- [ ] **Custom game adding** - Manual entries
