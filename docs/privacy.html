    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 12, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Panomi is a unified game launcher that helps you organize and launch games from multiple platforms. We are committed to protecting your privacy.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>Panomi does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers.</strong></p>
    <p>All data is stored locally on your device, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Game library information (detected from installed launchers)</li>
        <li>Application settings and preferences</li>
        <li>Game icons and metadata</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All application data is stored in your local AppData folder:</p>
    <code>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Panomi</code>
    <p>You can delete this folder at any time to remove all Panomi data from your device.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Panomi reads game information from launchers you have installed (Steam, Epic Games, GOG, etc.) but does not communicate with these services directly. Panomi only reads locally stored data.</p>

    <h2>Network Access</h2>
    <p>Panomi may access the internet only for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Checking for application updates (GitHub releases version only)</li>
        <li>Opening web links when you click on them in the app</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No personal data is transmitted during these operations.</p>
